# Digit Recognizer: A Simple ML Practice Project

This is a basic digit recognition web application built as a practice project to learn about machine learning and web development.

## Project Overview

- A web app that recognizes hand-drawn digits (0-9)
- Uses a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset
- Built with Flask and TensorFlow

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd "MNIST online"
3. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Flask app:
   python app.py
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`

## What I Learned

- Basics of building and training a CNN
- How to create a simple web application with Flask
- Integrating a ML model with a web interface
- Basic image preprocessing

## Note

It's a simple implementation to practice machine learning concepts and web development.
